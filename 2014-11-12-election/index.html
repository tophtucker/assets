<h1>The 2014 Election Map Without Democrats and Republicans</h1>
<h2>Libertarians took third place nationwide—with a cast of colorful sidekicks.</h2>

<p>If you eclipse the Sun, you see its corona: a wild aura of plasma loops, arcs, and jets, where gravity no longer holds sway. And so it is in American politics, where beneath the red and blue hides a polychrome menagerie.</p>
<p>The map below shows which party—and candidate—received the most votes in each county in last week's U.S. Senate election, excluding Democrats and Republicans. None of the candidates shown actually won.&nbsp;<em>(Seats in which no third-party candidate received enough votes to register are crosshatched and marked vacant; states in which there was no race are left blank. Colors are randomized.)</em></p>

<p>The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141116011306/http://www.lp.org/introduction/what-is-the-libertarian-party" data-web-url="http://www.lp.org/introduction/what-is-the-libertarian-party">Libertarian Party</a>—"for all who don't want to push other people around and don't want to be pushed around themselves"—received the third most votes nationally, collecting 846,000 of the 45 million total votes cast for Senate candidates. No Libertarian candidate received more than 4.3% of the vote. (That was Randall Batson in Kansas.)</p>
<p>Independent candidates are not affiliated with any political party. &nbsp;(Though voters hoping to declare similar autonomy are <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141116011306/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/opinion/independent-of-the-independence-party.html?_r=0" data-web-url="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/opinion/independent-of-the-independence-party.html?_r=0">sometimes&nbsp;snared by</a> the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141116011306/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Party_of_America" data-web-url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Party_of_America">Independence Party</a>.) <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141116011306/http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-10-13/south-dakota-upstart-pushes-independence-and-poetry" target="_blank">Larry Pressler in South Dakota</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141116011306/http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-10-08/meet-greg-orman-the-unelected-unaffiliated-seemingly-unstoppable-senate-candidate-in-kansas" target="_blank">Greg Orman in Kansas</a>&nbsp;were&nbsp;two independents (best to use a lowercase "i") who made their Democrat and Republican opponents sweat a little—or at least made the election-season media frenzy&nbsp;more interesting.</p>
<p>The Green Party shows up prominently on the Mexican border, across Arkansas, and in Delaware, with local affiliates West Virginia Mountain Party and Oregon Pacific Green Party coming in right&nbsp;behind Democrats and Republicans in some counties.</p>
<p>The rhetoric of these minor party candidates is defiant. “Most laws are a form of violence,” reads&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141116011306/http://batson4senate.weebly.com/" data-web-url="http://batson4senate.weebly.com/">Batson’s campaign website</a>.

Environmentally I support transitioning, over time, from coal to alternative energy sources, primarily solar. (Updates and revisions forthcoming.)”</p>
